In today's world, an operating system is a common computer component. An operating system (OS) is a complex collection of software applications that aid in the organization of data within a computer's hardware. It can store and retrieve data from memory systems and hard drives. It can also control programs and applications on the computer or from external sources. As an organizing tool, an operating system communicates between the hardware and the programs. When you click on a program file to obtain stored information, for example, the operating system sends a command to the hardware, which retrieves the desired data. This means that the operating system, which specifies the set of processes and regulations that applications and hardware must follow to keep the computer system in order, is the sole method for them to interact.
In today's age, there are a plethora of frequently recognized operating systems. They can be found in a variety of electronic devices, such as computers, phones, video games, tablets, portable music players, and websites. Macintosh is now recognized for generating several operating systems, notably Mac OS and Mac OS X. Google previously released the Google Chrome operating system, which was built on the foundations of an older system known as the Linux kernel, which was one of the first to be used on a variety of devices. Linux, in turn, is descended from UNIX, the original family of operating systems, which includes the popular BSD subgroup. Microsoft Windows is another widely used operating system that comes in a variety of variants.
There are numerous operating systems to choose from. Some are more popular than others, but they all offer advantages. Some features are based on timelines and real-time occurrences. These programs are known as real-time operating systems, and they can be found in scheduled updates, reservation programs, and other time-related duties.

Operating systems are divided into five categories. Operating systems such as Real Time, Embedded, Distributed, Multi-tasking, and Batch are examples. All five are very important. When dealing with real-time data, real-time operating systems are utilized. So, as soon as the data arrives, the procedure should be completed with no delays, — in other words no buffer delays. Real-time OS is a time-sharing system based on the clock interrupt concept. As a result, whenever you need to process a large number of requests in a short amount of time, you should use a Real-time Operating System. An Embedded Operating System is a type of operating system that is built to accomplish a specific purpose for a device that isn't a computer. We have multiple systems in a Distributed Operating System, and each of these systems has its own CPU, main memory, secondary memory, and resources. These systems communicate with one another using a shared communication network. With the help of the time-sharing principle, multiple processes are conducted at the same time in a Multi-tasking Operating System. Similar jobs are grouped together into batches in a Batch Operating System with the help of an operator, and these batches are completed one by one.

The topology of your network refers to how nodes, devices, and connections are physically or logically connected to one another. Consider your network to be a city, with the topology serving as the road map. There are numerous methods to arrange and manage a network, just as there are different ways to arrange and maintain a city—for example, ensuring that avenues and boulevards can enable movement between the busiest parts of town. Each has benefits and drawbacks, and depending on your company's needs, different arrangements can provide you with a higher level of connectivity and security.
Physical and logical topologies are the two types of network topology. The physical links and interconnections between nodes and the network—the wires, cables, and so on—are referred to as physical network topology, as the name suggests. Logical network topology is more abstract and strategic, referring to the conceptual knowledge of how and why the network is set up the way it is, as well as how data flows across it.
For a variety of reasons, the layout of your network is critical. Above all, it is critical to the operation and performance of your network. Choosing the correct topology for your company's operational model can improve performance while also making it easier to discover faults, rectify mistakes, and allocate resources more effectively across the network to ensure optimal network health. A streamlined and properly managed network topology can increase energy and data efficiency, which can in turn help to reduce operational and maintenance costs.
